1.migrating sample admin app to create tables in empty mysql schema

class User(models.Model):
    pass 

>this tables will only have id field.

1. Exec into admin backend container
>docker-compose exec backend sh
>python manage.py makemigrations
Migrations for 'products':
  products/migrations/0001_initial.py
    - Create model Product
    - Create model User
>python manage.py migrate

You can now see tables products_product and products_user in admin DB.
Models are created.

Part II:
  1.  When django returns objects in api, serializers are needed to process them.
  2.  Serializer not needed for User since we return random_id there.
  3.  Use the serializers in Views next. All 5 methods for CRUD. Viewset is one of the ways to implement this.
