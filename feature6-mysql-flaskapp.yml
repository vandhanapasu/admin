feature6:
  In products model in flaskkapp, autoincrement=False since product will be created in django app(by admin for our student evaluation tool). And we will have same id in both tables - main and admin
  No likes in this product.
  UniqueConstraint will make sure user_id and product_id will be unique and not be repeated.

  Now migration starts with manager.py
  >docker-compose exec backend sh
  >python manager.py db --help
  >python manager.py db init [creates migration files]
  >python manager.py db migrate

  Create new mysql connection for main
  New default table would have been created with above migration

  >python manager.py db upgrade
  Product and product_user table would have been created

  This is how flask is connected to mysql using docker
